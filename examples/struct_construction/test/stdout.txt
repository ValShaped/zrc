=== Struct Construction Examples ===

1. Named struct construction:
Point { x: 0, y: 0 }
Point { x: 50, y: 50 }

2. Multi-field struct construction:
Color { r: 255, g: 0, b: 0 }
Color { r: 0, g: 255, b: 0 }
Color { r: 0, g: 0, b: 255 }

3. Using struct fields in calculations:
Distance squared between Point { x: 3, y: 4 }
and Point { x: 6, y: 8 }
is 25
